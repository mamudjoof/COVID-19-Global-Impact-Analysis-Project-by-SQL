OVERVIEW
This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 data to assess infection rates, mortality rates, vaccination coverage, and trends across countries and continents. 
By leveraging SQL queries, we aim to extract meaningful insights from the data, which can be further visualized and interpreted using Power BI. 
The goal is to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 across different regions, highlighting disparities in health outcomes and vaccination efforts.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL
Understanding COVID-19 trends is crucial for public health policy and resource allocation. This project provides:
1. Insights into Infection Rates: Analyze how different countries are faring in terms of COVID-19 infection rates relative to their populations.
2. Mortality Analysis: Examine the probability of death upon contracting COVID-19 in various countries, helping to identify regions that may need additional support.
3. It provides insights into the total number of new cases, deaths, testing rates, vaccination progress, and epidemiological trends.
4. Vaccination Coverage: Evaluate how vaccination efforts are progressing across different nations and continents, allowing for a better understanding of herd immunity and public health readiness.
5. Data-Driven Decisions: Equip stakeholders with data insights to inform decisions on healthcare policies and pandemic responses.


HOW USERS CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT
To get started with the project, users can follow these steps:
1. Access Data: Obtain access to COVID-19 datasets from ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
2. Set Up the Database: Ensure you have a SQL server where you can create the necessary tables for CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. Use the provided SQL scripts to set up the database.
3. Run the SQL Queries: Execute the SQL queries provided in the project to extract the data necessary for your analysis. These queries will help you gather insights into infection rates, mortality, and vaccination statistics.
4. Import Data into Power BI: Once the data is extracted, you can import the results into Power BI to create visualizations. Use the visuals to analyze trends over time and draw conclusions from the data.

 FUTURE PLANS
 We aim to continuously improve this project by:
1. Incorporating additional data sources to enhance analysis.
2. Developing interactive dashboards in Power BI for better user engagement.
3. Conducting further research on the implications of the data and sharing findings with the broader community
