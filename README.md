# TITLE: SQL AND POWER BI ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL COVID-19 DATA

# OBJECTIVE
This project aims to analyze global COVID-19 data to uncover patterns and trendsto understand the dynamics of COVID-19 across different regions. By leveraging SQL for data exploration and analysis, 
the project provides actionable insights that can be visualized in Power BI dashboards to enhance understanding, inform policies, and guide public health decisions.

# SOURCES OF DATA
The dataset for this analysis was sourced from the official COVID-19 website. The link is https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. Note the data update daily.

# METHODOLOGY
1. **SQL Exploration**: A series of SQL queries were executed to:
    + Identify key metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination rates.
    + Analyze disparities and trends across countries and continents.
    + Highlight daily, cumulative, and comparative insights into the pandemic.

2. **Visualization**:
   The results of the SQL queries were exported to Power BI to create interactive and dynamic dashboards, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret and explore the data.

# SQL Exploration
The following SQL queries and analyses were conducted to address the projectâ€™s objectives:
+ Global Analysis: Counted the number of continents and countries represented in the dataset to ensure data completeness.
+ Mortality Analysis: Calculated probabilities of dying after contracting COVID-19 for specific countries, such as Poland, and continents.
+ Infection Rates: Determined the percentage of populations infected in various countries and identified those with the highest and lowest infection rates relative to their populations.
+ Vaccination Analysis: Investigated global vaccination trends, including daily and cumulative vaccination coverage at country and continent levels.
+ Disparity Analysis: Highlighted countries with the largest disparities between cases and deaths to understand regional variations in healthcare outcomes.
+ Trend Analysis: Examined daily trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations to assess the progression of the pandemic over time.
+ Comparative Metrics: Evaluated total cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage to identify continents and countries with the most significant challenges and successes in handling COVID-19.

# WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL
Understanding COVID-19 trends is crucial for public health policy and resource allocation. This project provides:
1. Insights into Infection Rates: Analyze how different countries are faring in terms of COVID-19 infection rates relative to their populations.
2. Mortality Analysis: Examine the probability of death upon contracting COVID-19 in various countries, helping to identify regions that may need additional support.
3. It provides insights into the total number of new cases, deaths, testing rates, vaccination progress, and epidemiological trends.
4. Vaccination Coverage: Evaluate how vaccination efforts are progressing across different nations and continents, allowing for a better understanding of herd immunity and public health readiness.
5. Data-Driven Decisions: Equip stakeholders with data insights to inform decisions on healthcare policies and pandemic responses.


# HOW USERS CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT
To get started with the project, users can follow these steps:
1. Access Data: Obtain access to COVID-19 datasets from ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
2. Set Up the Database: Ensure you have a SQL server where you can create the necessary tables for CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. Use the provided SQL scripts to set up the database.
3. Run the SQL Queries: Execute the SQL queries provided in the project to extract the data necessary for your analysis. These queries will help you gather insights into infection rates, mortality, and vaccination statistics.
4. Import Data into Power BI: Once the data is extracted, you can import the results into Power BI to create visualizations. Use the visuals to analyze trends over time and draw conclusions from the data.

 # FUTURE PLANS
 We aim to continuously improve this project by:
1. Incorporating additional data sources to enhance analysis.
2. Developing interactive dashboards in Power BI for better user engagement.
3. Conducting further research on the implications of the data and sharing findings with the broader community
