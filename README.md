# TITLE: SQL AND POWER BI ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL COVID-19 DATA

# OBJECTIVE
This project aims to analyze global COVID-19 data to uncover patterns and trendsto understand the dynamics of COVID-19 across different regions. By leveraging SQL for data exploration and analysis, 
the project provides actionable insights that can be visualized in Power BI dashboards to enhance understanding, inform policies, and guide public health decisions.

# SOURCES OF DATA
The dataset for this analysis was sourced from the official COVID-19 website. The link is https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. Note the data update daily.

# METHODOLOGY
1. **SQL Exploration**: A series of SQL queries were executed to:
    + Identify key metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination rates.
    + Analyze disparities and trends across countries and continents.
    + Highlight daily, cumulative, and comparative insights into the pandemic.

2. **Visualization**:
   The results of the SQL queries were exported to Power BI to create interactive and dynamic dashboards, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret and explore the data.

# SQL Exploration
The following SQL queries and analyses were conducted to address the projectâ€™s objectives:
+ Global Analysis: Counted the number of continents and countries represented in the dataset to ensure data completeness.
+ Mortality Analysis: Calculated probabilities of dying after contracting COVID-19 for specific countries, such as Poland, and continents.
+ Infection Rates: Determined the percentage of populations infected in various countries and identified those with the highest and lowest infection rates relative to their populations.
+ Vaccination Analysis: Investigated global vaccination trends, including daily and cumulative vaccination coverage at country and continent levels.
+ Disparity Analysis: Highlighted countries with the largest disparities between cases and deaths to understand regional variations in healthcare outcomes.
+ Trend Analysis: Examined daily trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations to assess the progression of the pandemic over time.
+ Comparative Metrics: Evaluated total cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage to identify continents and countries with the most significant challenges and successes in handling COVID-19.

# TOOLS AND SOFTWARE USED
 + **SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)**: For querying and analyzing the dataset.
 + **Power BI**: For designing and publishing interactive dashboards and visualizations.

# KEY INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS
The project yielded several critical insights:
Infection rates and mortality rates vary significantly across countries and continents, reflecting differences in healthcare systems, policies, and socio-economic factors.
High vaccination rates correlate strongly with reduced mortality, underscoring the importance of widespread vaccine distribution.
Some countries and continents show exceptional progress in controlling the pandemic through high vaccination coverage and strict mitigation measures.
Analysis of daily trends reveals the effectiveness of lockdowns, vaccination campaigns, and public health interventions over time.
Disparities in cases and deaths highlight the need for equitable access to healthcare resources worldwide.
